# android-pokedex-app

This project is part of CSC 2053: Platform Computing at Villanova University. <br>
Student Contributers: Daniel Perez (Galactius), Khang Bui (KhangBui02), and Nate Diaz (NateTheCat)<br>
<br>
The requirements for this assignment included:<br> 
1. An Android Application <br>
2. A RecyclerView <br>
3. A data source <br>
4. Two or more Activities <br>
<br>
Our submission for this assignment involves creating a simple "PokeDex" android application using the PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/). Our basic plan is to show a list of pokemon names on a list in a RecyclerView, when users click on a certain entry, a primary activity will open that shows more details and statistics about the selected pokemon. In the detailed (primary activity) screen, we intend to add a button to access a secondary activity screen where users will see more “fun” details about the specific pokemon like sprite samples from games, or sound effects. We intend to obtain our data from the pokedex API (https://pokeapi.co/), and may add more features and functionality as development progresses. <br>
<br>
Individual Member Responsibilities (subject to change during project): <br>
Daniel: RecyclerView and custom Adapter, primary activity. <br>
Khang: Layouts for the activities, part of the secondary activity. <br>
Nate: API Handling and Integration, part of the secondary activity. <br>
